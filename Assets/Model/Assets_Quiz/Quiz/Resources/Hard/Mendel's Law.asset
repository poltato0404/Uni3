    options:
    - Genes for different traits are inherited independently
    - Alleles for a gene segregate during gamete formation
    - 'Dominant alleles mask the effects of recessive alleles '
    - An organism's genotype determines its phenotypeAn organism's genotype determines
      its phenotype
    correctAns: Genes for different traits are inherited independently

    options:
    - Genotype is observable traits, phenotype is the combination of alleles
    - Genotype is the combination of alleles, phenotype is observable traits
    - Genotype and phenotype are the same
    - Genotype is the combination of alleles, phenotype is influenced by the environment
    correctAns: Genotype is the combination of alleles, phenotype is observable traits
